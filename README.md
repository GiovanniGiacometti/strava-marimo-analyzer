# Strava Marimo Analyzer üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è‚ÄãüèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

A [Marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/) notebook for visualizing and analyzing your [Strava](https://strava.com/) activity data!

üöÄ Powered by:
- [`strava-client`](https://github.com/GiovanniGiacometti/strava-client)
- [`polars`](https://pola.rs/)
- [`altair`](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html)
- [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/)

üåê A web-based version, running entirely in your browser via WebAssembly (WASM), is available [here](https://giovannigiacometti.it/strava-marimo-analyzer/).

## ‚ú® Features

The core feature of the dashboard is the **Activity Heatmap**, which provides a visual representation of the number of activities and total distance (in kilometers) over time. This interactive heatmap also displays key statistics for the currently selected activities ‚Äî such as total number of activities, total distance, and average speed.

As both a developer and a runner, building a GitHub-style activity heatmap had been a long-time dream of mine! ü§ì

In addition to the heatmap, the app includes three other visualizations that provide deeper insights into the selected activities:

- **Activity Focus**: a line plot showing speed over time for individual activities. You can select multiple activities from a dropdown to compare their speed profiles side-by-side.

- **Distance Distribution**: an aggregated histogram that shows how the distances of the selected activities are distributed.

- **Speed Distribution**: n aggregated histogram that displays the distribution of speeds across the selected activities.

I invite you to explore the dashboard [here](https://giovannigiacometti.it/strava-marimo-analyzer/) to see these visualizations in action!

The dashboard should be easy to be extended with new visualizations. If you have ideas for new visualizations or features, feel free to open a pull request or reach out ‚Äî contributions are very welcome!


## üì• Get Started with your data!

To begin, you'll need to authenticate your Strava account. The full process is explained in the [strava-client documentation](https://github.com/GiovanniGiacometti/strava-client?tab=readme-ov-file#authentication).


### If you are running this notebook locally

You can either provide your credentials through a .env file or set them directly in your terminal. When you run the notebook for the first time, a browser tab will open to authenticate your Strava account and retrieve an access token. All information are saved in a file called `.strava.secrets` file so you won‚Äôt need to re-authenticate in future sessions (make sure it is gitignored!).

### If you are using the web-based WASM version

You have two options, selectable via the form at the top of the notebook:

1) **Enter your own credentials:**
Since the browser cannot perform the full authentication flow, you need to retrieve the necessary information beforehand ‚Äî for instance by using the `strava-client` locally. Note that this information is not stored in the browser, so you'll need to re-enter it each time you reload the page.

2) **Use sample (mocked) data:**
This option loads a set of pre-generated data based on my personal Strava activity. It allows you to explore the dashboard without needing your own Strava account or a Strava application setup.
